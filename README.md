# ACM.S_Screen_Shake
The base project for ACM Studio's Winter 2023 Screen Shake and Camera Control tutorial

The BaseScene contains the base project within which you will add a script called `CameraController`. A completed camera controller script (called `CameraController_Finished`) is provided and implemented in FinishedScene.
